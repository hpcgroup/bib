abstract = {Rich information matrices from first and second-order derivatives have many potential applications in both theoretical and practical problems in deep learning. However, computing these information matrices is extremely expensive and this enormous cost is currently limiting its application to important problems regarding generalization, hyperparameter tuning, and optimization of deep neural networks. One of the most challenging use cases of information matrices is their use as a preconditioner for the optimizers, since the information matrices need to be updated every step. In this work, we conduct a step-by-step performance analysis when computing the Fisher information matrix during training of ResNet-50 on ImageNet, and show that the overhead can be reduced to the same amount as the cost of performing a single SGD step. We also show that the resulting Fisher preconditioned optimizer can converge in 1/3 the number of epochs compared to SGD, while achieving the same Top-1 validation accuracy. This is the first work to achieve such accuracy with K-FAC while reducing the training time to match that of SGD.},

Due to the large number of parameters of machine learning problems, full-matrix preconditioning methods are prohibitively expensive. We show how to modify full-matrix adaptive regularization in order to make it practical and effective. We also provide a novel theoretical analysis for adaptive regularization in <em>non-convex</em> optimization settings. The core of our algorithm, termed GGT, consists of the efficient computation of the inverse square root of a low-rank matrix. Our preliminary experiments show improved iteration-wise convergence rates across synthetic tasks and standard deep learning benchmarks, and that the more carefully-preconditioned steps sometimes lead to a better solution.}

Utilizing recent advances in the Hessian-free optimization approach (Martens, 2010), together with a novel damping scheme, we successfully train RNNs on two sets of challenging problems. First, a collection of pathological synthetic datasets which are known to be impossible for standard optimization approaches (due to their extremely long-term dependencies), and second, on three natural and highly complex real-world sequence datasets where we find that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method for training neural sequence models: the Long Short-term Memory approach of Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). Additionally, we offer a new interpretation of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix of Schraudolph (2002) which is used within the HF approach of Martens.},

abstract = {Natural gradient descent is an optimization method traditionally motivated from the perspective of information geometry, and works well for many applications as an alternative to stochastic gradient descent. In this paper we critically analyze this method and its properties, and show how it can be viewed as a type of 2nd-order optimization method, with the Fisher information matrix acting as a substitute for the Hessian. In many important cases, the Fisher information matrix is shown to be equivalent to the Generalized Gauss-Newton matrix, which both approximates the Hessian, but also has certain properties that favor its use over the Hessian. This perspective turns out to have significant implications for the design of a practical and robust natural gradient optimizer, as it motivates the use of techniques like trust regions and Tikhonov regularization. Additionally, we make a series of contributions to the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods, including: a thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used "empirical" approximation of the Fisher matrix, and an analysis of the (approximate) parameterization invariance property possessed by natural gradient methods (which we show also holds for certain other curvature matrices, but notably not the Hessian).},

Information geometry is used for calculating the natural gradients in the parameter space of perceptrons, the space of matrices (for blind source separation), and the space of linear dynamical systems (for blind source deconvolution). The dynamical behavior of natural gradient online learning is analyzed and is proved to be Fisher efficient, implying that it has asymptotically the same performance as the optimal batch estimation of parameters. This suggests that the plateau phenomenon, which appears in the backpropagation learning algorithm of multilayer perceptrons, might disappear or might not be so serious when the natural gradient is used. An adaptive method of updating the learning rate is proposed and analyzed.}",

Unlike first-order methods, for which hyperparameter tuning of the optimisation parameters is often a laborious process, our approach can provide good performance even when used with default settings. A side result of our work is that for piecewise linear transfer functions, the network objective function can have no differentiable local maxima, which may partially explain why such transfer functions facilitate effective optimisation.}

In our method, we construct on each iteration a Krylov subspace formed by the gradient and an approximation to the Hessian matrix, and then use a subset of the training data samples to optimize over this subspace.  As with the Hessian Free (HF) method of Martens (2010), the Hessian matrix is never explicitly constructed, and is computed using a subset of data.  In practice, as in HF, we typically use a positive definite substitute for the Hessian matrix such as the Gauss-Newton matrix.  We investigate the effectiveness of our proposed method on deep neural networks, and compare its performance to widely used methods such as stochastic gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent and L-BFGS, and also to HF. Our method leads to faster convergence than either L-BFGS or HF, and generally performs better than either of them in cross-validation accuracy.  It is also simpler and more general than HF, as it does not require a positive semidefinite approximation of the Hessian matrix to work well nor the setting of a damping parameter.  The chief drawback versus HF is the need for memory to store a basis for the Krylov subspace.}

abstract = {We propose a generic method for iteratively approximating various second-order gradient steps--Newton, Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt, and natural gradient--in linear time per iteration, using special curvature matrix-vector products that can be computed in O(n). Two recent acceleration techniques for on-line learning, matrix momentum and stochastic meta-descent (SMD), implement this approach. Since both were originally derived by very different routes, this offers fresh insight into their operation, resulting in further improvements to SMD.},

abstract = {For the solution of the functional equation P (x) = 0 (1) (where P is an operator, usually linear, from B into B, and B is a Banach space) iteration methods are generally used. These consist of the construction of a series x0, …, xn, …, which converges to the solution (see, for example [1]). Continuous analogues of these methods are also known, in which a trajectory x(t), 0 ⩽ t ⩽ ∞ is constructed, which satisfies the ordinary differential equation in B and is such that x(t) approaches the solution of (1) as t → ∞ (see [2]). We shall call the method a k-step method if for the construction of each successive iteration xn+1 we use k previous iterations xn, …, xn−k+1. The same term will also be used for continuous methods if x(t) satisfies a differential equation of the k-th order or k-th degree. Iteration methods which are more widely used are one-step (e.g. methods of successive approximations). They are generally simple from the calculation point of view but often converge very slowly. This is confirmed both by the evaluation of the speed of convergence and by calculation in practice (for more details see below). Therefore the question of the rate of convergence is most important. Some multistep methods, which we shall consider further, which are only slightly more complicated than the corresponding one-step methods, make it possible to speed up the convergence substantially. Note that all the methods mentioned below are applicable also to the problem of minimizing the differentiable functional (x) in Hilbert space, so long as this problem reduces to the solution of the equation grad (x) = 0.}

  abstract = 	 {Preconditioned gradient methods are among the most general and powerful tools in optimization. However, preconditioning requires storing and manipulating prohibitively large matrices. We describe and analyze a new structure-aware preconditioning algorithm, called Shampoo, for stochastic optimization over tensor spaces. Shampoo maintains a set of preconditioning matrices, each of which operates on a single dimension, contracting over the remaining dimensions. We establish convergence guarantees in the stochastic convex setting, the proof of which builds upon matrix trace inequalities. Our experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning models show that Shampoo is capable of converging considerably faster than commonly used optimizers. Surprisingly, although it involves a more complex update rule, Shampoo’s runtime per step is comparable in practice to that of simple gradient methods such as SGD, AdaGrad, and Adam.}

We derive a tight lower bound of the amount of data that must be communicated in order to complete this operation and propose a ring-based algorithm that only requires tree connectivity to achieve bandwidth optimality. Unlike the widely used butterfly-like all-reduce algorithm that incurs network contention in SMP/multi-core clusters, the proposed algorithm can achieve contention-free communication in almost all contemporary clusters, including SMP/multi-core clusters and Ethernet switched clusters with multiple switches. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than other algorithms on clusters with different nodal architectures and networking technologies when the data size is sufficiently large.},

We introduce three algorithms that partition channel or filter data to exploit parallelism beyond the sample dimension. Further, they partition the parameters of convolutional layers, replacing global all reduces with segmented allreduces---smaller, concurrent allreduces among disjoint processor sets. These algorithms enable strong scaling, reduced communication overhead, and reduced memory pressure, enabling training of very wide CNNs.We demonstrate improved strong and weak scaling, including up to 4.1x reductions in training time for residual networks and 4x reductions in allreduce overhead. We also show that wider models provide improved accuracy on ImageNet. We study the current limitations of our algorithms and provide a direction for future optimizations of large-scale deep learning frameworks.},

abstract = {Modern high performance computing platforms employ burst buffers to overcome the I/O bottleneck that limits the scale and efficiency of large-scale parallel computations. Currently there are two competing burst buffer architectures. One is to treat burst buffers as a dedicated shared resource, The other is to integrate burst buffer hardware into each compute node. In this paper we examine the design tradeoffs associated with local and shared, dedicated burst buffer architectures through modeling. By seeding our simulation with realistic workloads, we are able to systematically evaluate the resulting performance of both designs. Our studies validate previous results indicating that storage systems without parity protection can reduce overall time to solution, and further determine that shared burst buffer organizations can result in a 3.5\texttimes{} greater average application I/O throughput compared to local burst buffer configurations.},

abstract = {The success of DNN comes at the expense of excessive memory/computation cost, which can be addressed by exploiting reduced precision and sparsity jointly. Existing sparse GPU kernels, however, fail to achieve practical speedup over cuBLASHgemm under half-precision. Those for fine-grained sparsity suffer from low data reuse, and others for coarse-grained sparsity are limited by the wrestling between kernel performance and model quality under different grain sizes. We propose column-vector-sparse-encoding that has a smaller grain size under the same reuse rate compared with block sparsity. Column-vector-sparse-encoding can be applied to both SpMM & SDDMM, two major sparse DNN operations. We also introduce the Tensor-Core-based 1D Octet Tiling that has efficient memory access and computation patterns under small grain size. Based on these, we design SpMM and SDDMM kernels and achieve 1.71-7.19x speedup over cuSPARSE. Practical speedup is achieved over cuBLASHgemm under >70% and >90% sparsity with 4x1 grain size and half-precision.},

abstract = {Tiling is a key technique for data locality optimization and is widely used in high-performance implementations of dense matrix-matrix multiplication for multicore/manycore CPUs and GPUs. However, the irregular and matrix-dependent data access pattern of sparse matrix multiplication makes it challenging to use tiling to enhance data reuse. In this paper, we devise an adaptive tiling strategy and apply it to enhance the performance of two primitives: SpMM (product of sparse matrix and dense matrix) and SDDMM (sampled dense-dense matrix multiplication). In contrast to studies that have resorted to non-standard sparse-matrix representations to enhance performance, we use the standard Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) representation, within which intra-row reordering is performed to enable adaptive tiling. Experimental evaluation using an extensive set of matrices from the Sparse Suite collection demonstrates significant performance improvement over currently available state-of-the-art alternatives.},

We consider this phenomenon from the perspective of the lottery ticket hypothesis, using both structured and magnitude pruning. For fine-tuned BERT, we show that (a) it is possible to find subnetworks achieving performance that is comparable with that of the full model, and (b) similarly-sized subnetworks sampled from the rest of the model perform worse. Strikingly, with structured pruning even the worst possible subnetworks remain highly trainable, indicating that most pre-trained BERT weights are potentially useful. We also study the {``}good{''} subnetworks to see if their success can be attributed to superior linguistic knowledge, but find them unstable, and not explained by meaningful self-attention patterns.",

This is relevant both for time-critical and on-device computations using neural networks. The stabilized lottery ticket hypothesis states that networks can be pruned after none or few training iterations, using a mask computed based on the unpruned converged model. On the transformer architecture and the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French tasks, we show that stabilized lottery ticket pruning performs similar to magnitude pruning for sparsity levels of up to 85{\%}, and propose a new combination of pruning techniques that outperforms all other techniques for even higher levels of sparsity. Furthermore, we confirm that the parameter{'}s initial sign and not its specific value is the primary factor for successful training, and show that magnitude pruning cannot be used to find winning lottery tickets.",

abstract = {Computational science applications are driving a demand for increasingly powerful storage systems. While many techniques are available for capturing the I/O behavior of individual application trial runs and specific components of the storage system, continuous characterization of a production system remains a daunting challenge for systems with hundreds of thousands of compute cores and multiple petabytes of storage. As a result, these storage systems are often designed without a clear understanding of the diverse computational science workloads they will support.In this study, we outline a methodology for scalable, continuous, systemwide I/O characterization that combines storage device instrumentation, static file system analysis, and a new mechanism for capturing detailed application-level behavior. This methodology allows us to identify both system-wide trends and application-specific I/O strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by performing a multilevel, two-month study of Intrepid, a 557-teraflop IBM Blue Gene/P system. During that time, we captured application-level I/O characterizations from 6,481 unique jobs spanning 38 science and engineering projects. We used the results of our study to tune example applications, highlight trends that impact the design of future storage systems, and identify opportunities for improvement in I/O characterization methodology.},

abstractNote = {NVRAM-based Burst Buffers are an important part of the emerging HPC storage landscape. The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory recently installed one of the first Burst Buffer systems as part of its new Cori supercomputer, collaborating with Cray on the development of the DataWarp software. NERSC has a diverse user base comprised of over 6500 users in 700 different projects spanning a wide variety of scientific computing applications. The use-cases of the Burst Buffer at NERSC are therefore also considerable and diverse. We describe here performance measurements and lessons learned from the Burst Buffer Early User Program at NERSC, which selected a number of research projects to gain early access to the Burst Buffer and exercise its capability to enable new scientific advancements. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a Burst Buffer has been stressed at scale by diverse, real user workloads and therefore these lessons will be of considerable benefit to shaping the developing use of Burst Buffers at HPC centers.},

abstract = {A momentum term is usually included in the simulations of connectionist learning algorithms. Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.}

  abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;The effort devoted to hand-crafting neural network image classifiers has motivated the use of architecture search to discover them automatically. Although evolutionary algorithms have been repeatedly applied to neural network topologies, the image classifiers thus discovered have remained inferior to human-crafted ones. Here, we evolve an image classifier— &lt;em&gt;AmoebaNet-A&lt;/em&gt;—that surpasses hand-designs for the first time. To do this, we modify the tournament selection evolutionary algorithm by introducing an age property to favor the younger genotypes. Matching size, AmoebaNet-A has comparable accuracy to current state-of-the-art ImageNet models discovered with more complex architecture-search methods. Scaled to larger size, AmoebaNet-A sets a new state-of-theart 83.9% top-1 / 96.6% top-5 ImageNet accuracy. In a controlled comparison against a well known reinforcement learning algorithm, we give evidence that evolution can obtain results faster with the same hardware, especially at the earlier stages of the search. This is relevant when fewer compute resources are available. Evolution is, thus, a simple method to effectively discover high-quality architectures.&lt;/p&gt;},

  abstract = {Data-parallelism has become an established paradigm to train DNNs that fit inside GPU memory on large-scale HPC systems. However, model-parallelism is required to train out-of-core DNNs. In this paper, we deal with emerging requirements brought forward by very large DNNs being trained using high-resolution images common in digital pathology. To address these, we propose, design, and implement GEMS; a GPU-Enabled Memory-Aware Model-Parallelism System. We present several design schemes like GEMS-MAST, GEMS-MASTER, and GEMS-Hybrid that offer excellent speedups over state-of-the-art systems like Mesh-TensorFlow and FlexFlow. Furthermore, we combine model-parallelism and data-parallelism to train a 1000-layer ResNet-1k model using 1,024 Volta V100 GPUs with 97.32% scaling-efficiency. For the real-world histopathology whole-slide-image (WSI) of 100,000 x 100,000 pixels, we train custom ResNet-110-v2 on image tiles of size 1024 x 1024 and reduce the training time from seven hours to 28 minutes.},

abstract = {The most widely used machine learning frameworks require users to carefully tune their memory usage so that the deep neural network (DNN) fits into the DRAM capacity of a GPU. This restriction hampers a researcher's flexibility to study different machine learning algorithms, forcing them to either use a less desirable network architecture or parallelize the processing across multiple GPUs. We propose a runtime memory manager that virtualizes the memory usage of DNNs such that both GPU and CPU memory can simultaneously be utilized for training larger DNNs. Our virtualized DNN (vDNN) reduces the average GPU memory usage of AlexNet by up to 89%, OverFeat by 91%, and GoogLeNet by 95%, a significant reduction in memory requirements of DNNs. Similar experiments on VGG-16, one of the deepest and memory hungry DNNs to date, demonstrate the memory-efficiency of our proposal. vDNN enables VGG-16 with batch size 256 (requiring 28 GB of memory) to be trained on a single NVIDIA Titan X GPU card containing 12 GB of memory, with 18% performance loss compared to a hypothetical, oracular GPU with enough memory to hold the entire DNN.},

Tensor-Flow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

Our approach is to use large batch size, powered by the Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS) algorithm, for efficient usage of massive computing resources. Our approach is generic, as we empirically evaluate the effectiveness on two neural networks: AlexNet and ResNet-50 trained with the ImageNet-1k dataset while preserving the state-of-the-art test accuracy. Compared to the baseline of a previous study from a group of researchers at Facebook, our approach shows higher test accuracy on batch sizes that are larger than 16K. Using 2,048 Intel Xeon Platinum 8160 processors, we reduce the 100-epoch AlexNet training time from hours to 11 minutes. With 2,048 Intel Xeon Phi 7250 Processors, we reduce the 90-epoch ResNet-50 training time from hours to 20 minutes. Our implementation is open source and has been released in the Intel distribution of Caffe v1.0.7.},

  abstract = {The dedicated memory of hardware accelerators can be insufficient to store all weights and/or intermediate states of large deep learning models. Although model parallelism is a viable approach to reduce the memory pressure issue, significant modification of the source code and considerations for algorithms are required. An alternative solution is to use out-of-core methods instead of, or in addition to, data parallelism.We propose a performance model based on the concurrency analysis of out-of-core training behavior, and derive a strategy that combines layer swapping and redundant recomputing. We achieve an average of 1.52x speedup in six different models over the state-of-the-art out-of-core methods. We also introduce the first method to solve the challenging problem of out-of-core multi-node training by carefully pipelining gradient exchanges and performing the parameter updates on the host. Our data parallel out-of-core solution can outperform complex hybrid model parallelism in training large models, e.g. Megatron-LM and Turning-NLG.},

  abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Graph neural networks have recently emerged as a very effective framework for processing graph-structured data. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks. Most graph neural networks can be described in terms of message passing, vertex update, and readout functions. In this paper, we represent documents as word co-occurrence networks and propose an application of the message passing framework to NLP, the Message Passing Attention network for Document understanding (MPAD). We also propose several hierarchical variants of MPAD. Experiments conducted on 10 standard text classification datasets show that our architectures are competitive with the state-of-the-art. Ablation studies reveal further insights about the impact of the different components on performance. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/giannisnik/mpad.&lt;/p&gt;},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the PyTorch distributed data parallel module. Py-Torch is a widely-adopted scientific computing package used in deep learning research and applications. Recent advances in deep learning argue for the value of large datasets and large models, which necessitates the ability to scale out model training to more computational resources. Data parallelism has emerged as a popular solution for distributed training thanks to its straightforward principle and broad applicability. In general, the technique of distributed data parallelism replicates the model on every computational resource to generate gradients independently and then communicates those gradients at each iteration to keep model replicas consistent. Despite the conceptual simplicity of the technique, the subtle dependencies between computation and communication make it non-trivial to optimize the distributed training efficiency. As of v1.5, PyTorch natively provides several techniques to accelerate distributed data parallel, including bucketing gradients, overlapping computation with communication, and skipping gradient synchronization. Evaluations show that, when configured appropriately, the PyTorch distributed data parallel module attains near-linear scalability using 256 GPUs.},

  abstract = {Large deep learning models offer significant accuracy gains, but training billions to trillions of parameters is challenging. Existing solutions such as data and model parallelisms exhibit fundamental limitations to fit these models into limited device memory, while obtaining computation, communication and development efficiency. We develop a novel solution, Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO), to optimize memory, vastly improving training speed while increasing the model size that can be efficiently trained. ZeRO eliminates memory redundancies in data- and model-parallel training while retaining low communication volume and high computational granularity, allowing us to scale the model size proportional to the number of devices with sustained high efficiency. Our analysis on memory requirements and communication volume demonstrates: ZeRO has the potential to scale beyond 1 Trillion parameters using today's hardware.We implement and evaluate ZeRO: it trains large models of over 100B parameter with super-linear speedup on 400 GPUs, achieving throughput of 15 Petaflops. This represents an 8x increase in model size and 10x increase in achievable performance over state-of-the-art. In terms of usability, ZeRO can train large models of up to 13B parameters (e.g., larger than Megatron GPT 8.3B and T5 11B) without requiring model parallelism which is harder for scientists to apply.

  abstract={Emerging infectious diseases are a major threat to health: AIDS, SARS, drug-resistant bacteria and Ebola virus are among the more recent examples. By identifying emerging disease 'hotspots', the thinking goes, it should be possible to spot health risks at an early stage and prepare containment strategies. An analysis of over 300 examples of disease emerging between 1940 and 2004 suggests that these hotspots can be accurately mapped based on socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors. The data show that the surveillance effort, and much current research spending, is concentrated in developed economies, yet the risk maps point to developing countries as the more likely source of new diseases.},

This paper provides suitable tools for the construction of algorithms which solve exactly the problem. Several approximation algorithms are presented for this NP-hard problem. The worst-case behavior of the algorithms is analyzed. The best of these algorithms achieves a performance bound of 4]3.},

Accelerating their training is a major challenge and techniques range from distributed algorithms to low-level circuit design. In this survey, we describe the problem from a theoretical perspective, followed by approaches for its parallelization. We present trends in DNN architectures and the resulting implications on parallelization strategies. We then review and model the different types of concurrency in DNNs: from the single operator, through parallelism in network inference and training, to distributed deep learning. We discuss asynchronous stochastic optimization, distributed system architectures, communication schemes, and neural architecture search. Based on those approaches, we extrapolate potential directions for parallelism in deep learning.},

  abstract = {The field of machine learning is witnessing its golden era as deep learning slowly becomes the leader in this domain. Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models. Some key enabler deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and model transfers have completely changed our perception of information processing. However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective. The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level. Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth. This article presents a comprehensive review of historical and recent state-of-the-art approaches in visual, audio, and text processing; social network analysis; and natural language processing, followed by the in-depth analysis on pivoting and groundbreaking advances in deep learning applications. It was also undertaken to review the issues faced in deep learning such as unsupervised learning, black-box models, and online learning and to illustrate how these challenges can be transformed into prolific future research avenues.},

  abstract = {Accelerating large-scale CNN training is needed to keep training times reasonable as datasets grow larger and models become more complex. Existing frameworks primarily scale using data-parallelism, but this is limited by the mini-batch size, which cannot grow arbitrarily. We introduce three algorithms that partition channel or filter data to exploit parallelism beyond the sample dimension. Further, they partition the parameters of convolutional layers, replacing global all reduces with segmented allreduces---smaller, concurrent allreduces among disjoint processor sets. These algorithms enable strong scaling, reduced communication overhead, and reduced memory pressure, enabling training of very wide CNNs.We demonstrate improved strong and weak scaling, including up to 4.1x reductions in training time for residual networks and 4x reductions in allreduce overhead. We also show that wider models provide improved accuracy on ImageNet. We study the current limitations of our algorithms and provide a direction for future optimizations of large-scale deep learning frameworks.},

  abstract={The performance of scheduling algorithms for HPC jobs highly depends on the accuracy of job runtime values. Prior research has established that neither user-provided runtimes nor system-generated runtime predictions are accurate. We propose a new scheduling platform that performs well in spite of runtime uncertainties. The key observation that we use for building our platform is the fact that two important classes of scheduling strategies (backfilling and plan based) differ in terms of sensitivity to runtime accuracy. We first confirm this observation by performing trace-based simulations to characterize the sensitivity of different scheduling strategies to job runtime accuracy. We then apply gradient boosting tree regression as a meta-learning approach to estimate the reliability of the system-generated job runtimes. The estimated prediction reliability of job runtimes is then used to choose a specific class of scheduling algorithm. Our hybrid scheduling platform uses a plan-based scheduling strategy for jobs with high expected runtime accuracy and backfills the remaining jobs on top of the planned jobs. While resource sharing is used to minimize fragmentation of resources, a specific ratio of CPU cores is reserved for backfilling of less predictable jobs to avoid starvation of these jobs. This ratio is adapted dynamically based on the resource requirement ratio of predictable jobs among recently submitted jobs. We perform extensive trace-driven simulations on real-world production traces to show that our hybrid scheduling platform outperforms both pure backfilling and pure plan-based scheduling algorithms.},

  abstract = {Dynamic scheduling of tasks in large-scale HPC platforms is normally accomplished using ad-hoc heuristics, based on task characteristics, combined with some backfilling strategy. Defining heuristics that work efficiently in different scenarios is a difficult task, specially when considering the large variety of task types and platform architectures. In this work, we present a methodology based on simulation and machine learning to obtain dynamic scheduling policies. Using simulations and a workload generation model, we can determine the characteristics of tasks that lead to a reduction in the mean slowdown of tasks in an execution queue. Modeling these characteristics using a nonlinear function and applying this function to select the next task to execute in a queue improved the mean task slowdown in synthetic workloads. When applied to real workload traces from highly different machines, these functions still resulted in performance improvements, attesting the generalization capability of the obtained heuristics.},

  abstract = {Today's high-performance computing (HPC) platforms are still dominated by batch jobs. Accordingly, effective batch job scheduling is crucial to obtain high system efficiency. Existing HPC batch job schedulers typically leverage heuristic priority functions to prioritize and schedule jobs. But, once configured and deployed by the experts, such priority functions can hardly adapt to the changes of job loads, optimization goals, or system settings, potentially leading to degraded system efficiency when changes occur. To address this fundamental issue, we present RLScheduler, an automated HPC batch job scheduler built on reinforcement learning. RLScheduler relies on minimal manual interventions or expert knowledge, but can learn high-quality scheduling policies via its own continuous 'trial and error'. We introduce a new kernel-based neural network structure and trajectory filtering mechanism in RLScheduler to improve and stabilize the learning process. Through extensive evaluations, we confirm that RLScheduler can learn high-quality scheduling policies towards various workloads and various optimization goals with relatively low computation cost. Moreover, we show that the learned models perform stably even when applied to unseen workloads, making them practical for production use.},

  abstract = {High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems are resources utilized for data capture, sharing, and analysis. The majority of our HPC users come from other disciplines than Computer Science. HPC users including computer scientists have difficulties and do not feel proficient enough to decide the required amount of resources for their submitted jobs on the cluster. Consequently, users are encouraged to over-estimate resources for their submitted jobs, so their jobs will not be killing due insufficient resources. This process will waste and devour HPC resources; hence, this will lead to inefficient cluster utilization. We created a supervised machine learning model and integrated it into the Slurm resource manager simulator to predict the amount of required memory resources (Memory) and the required amount of time to run the computation. Our model involves using different machine learning algorithms. Our goal is to integrate and test the proposed supervised machine learning model on Slurm. We used over 10000 tasks selected from our HPC log files to evaluate the performance and the accuracy of our integrated model. The purpose of our work is to increase the performance of the Slurm by predicting the amount of require jobs memory resources and the time required for each particular job in order to improve the utilization of the HPC system using our integrated supervised machine learning model.Our results indicate that for larger jobs our model helps dramatically reduce computational turnaround time (from five days to ten hours for large jobs), substantially increased utilization of the HPC system, and decreased the average waiting time for the submitted jobs.},

First, we analyze real workload logs and conduct application experiments on the production system Theta at Argonne to evaluate application performance variability. We find a strong correlation between system utilization and performance variability where a high system utilization (e.g., above 95%) can cause up to 21% degradation in application performance. Next, driven by this key finding, we investigate a scheduling policy to mitigate workload interference by leveraging the fact that production systems often exhibit diurnal utilization behavior and not all users are in a hurry for job completion. Preliminary results show that this scheduling design is capable of improving system productivity (measured by scheduling makespan) as well as improving user-level scheduling metrics such as user wait time and job slowdown.},

  abstract = {Efficient communication is a requirement for application scalability on High Performance Computing systems. In this paper we argue for incorporating proactive congestion avoidance mechanisms into the design of communication layers on manycore systems. This is in contrast with the status quo which employs a reactive approach, emph{e.g.} congestion control mechanisms are activated only when resources have been exhausted. We present a core stateless optimization approach based on open loop end-point throttling, implemented for two UPC runtimes (Cray and Berkeley UPC) and validated on InfiniBand and the Cray Gemini networks. Microbenchmark results indicate that throttling the number of messages in flight per core can provide up to 4X performance improvements, while throttling the number of active cores per node can provide additional 40% and 6X performance improvement for UPC and MPI respectively. We evaluate inline (each task makes independent decisions) and proxy (server) congestion avoidance designs. Our runtime provides both performance and performance portability. We improve all-to-all collective performance by up to 4X and provide better performance than vendor provided MPI and UPC implementations. We also demonstrate performance improvements of up to 60% in application settings. Overall, our results indicate that modern systems accommodate only a surprisingly small number of messages in flight per node. As Exascale projections indicate that future systems are likely to contain hundreds to thousands of cores per node, we believe that their networks will be underprovisioned. In this situation, proactive congestion avoidance might become mandatory for performance improvement and portability.},

  abstract = {Driven by the need to solve linear systems arising from problems posed on extremely large, unstructured grids, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in algebraic multigrid (AMG). AMG is attractive in that it holds out the possibility of multigrid-like performance on unstructured grids. The sheer size of many modern physics and simulation problems has led to the development of massively parallel computers, and has sparked much research into developing algorithms for them. Parallelizing AMG is a difficult task, however. While much of the AMG method parallelizes readily, the process of coarse-grid selection, in particular, is fundamentally sequential in nature. We have previously introduced a parallel algorithm [A.J. Cleary, R.D. Falgout, V.E. Henson, J.E. Jones, in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Solving Irregularly Structured Problems in Parallel, Springer, New York, 1998] for the selection of coarse-grid points, based on modifications of certain parallel independent set algorithms and the application of heuristics designed to insure the quality of the coarse grids, and shown results from a prototype serial version of the algorithm. In this paper we describe an implementation of a parallel AMG code, using the algorithm of A.J. Cleary, R.D. Falgout, V.E. Henson, J.E. Jones [in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Solving Irregularly Structured Problems in Parallel, Springer, New York, 1998] as well as other approaches to parallelizing the coarse-grid selection. We consider three basic coarsening schemes and certain modifications to the basic schemes, designed to address specific performance issues. We present numerical results for a broad range of problem sizes and descriptions, and draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of the method. Finally, we indicate the current directions of the research.}

  abstract = {GPUs have become prevalent and more general purpose, but GPU programming remains challenging and time consuming for the majority of programmers. In addition, it is not always clear which codes will benefit from getting ported to GPU. Therefore, having a tool to estimate GPU performance for a piece of code before writing a GPU implementation is highly desirable. To this end, we propose Cross-Architecture Performance Prediction (XAPP), a machine-learning based technique that uses only single-threaded CPU implementation to predict GPU performance.Our paper is built on the two following insights: i) Execution time on GPU is a function of program properties and hardware characteristics. ii) By examining a vast array of previously implemented GPU codes along with their CPU counterparts, we can use established machine learning techniques to learn this correlation between program properties, hardware characteristics and GPU execution time. We use an adaptive two-level machine learning solution. Our results show that our tool is robust and accurate: we achieve 26.9% average error on a set of 24 real-world kernels. We also discuss practical usage scenarios for XAPP.},

  abstract = {The field of big code relies on mining large corpora of code to perform some learning task towards creating better tools for software engineers. A significant threat to this approach was recently identified by Lopes et al. (2017) who found a large amount of near-duplicate code on GitHub. However, the impact of code duplication has not been noticed by researchers devising machine learning models for source code. In this work, we explore the effects of code duplication on machine learning models showing that reported performance metrics are sometimes inflated by up to 100% when testing on duplicated code corpora compared to the performance on de-duplicated corpora which more accurately represent how machine learning models of code are used by software engineers. We present a duplication index for widely used datasets, list best practices for collecting code corpora and evaluating machine learning models on them. Finally, we release tools to help the community avoid this problem in future research.},

One approach for studying epidemics is to simulate their spread through populations. In this work, we describe an integrated multi-dimensional approach to epidemic simulation, which encompasses: (1) a theoretical framework for simulation and analysis; (2) synthetic population (digital twin) generation; (3) (social contact) network construction methods from synthetic populations, (4) stylized network construction methods; and (5) simulation of the evolution of a virus or disease through a social network. We describe these aspects and end with a short discussion on simulation results that inform public policy.},

	abstract = {Geographically-explicit simulations have become crucial in understanding cities and are playing an important role in Urban Science. One such approach is that of agent-based modeling which allows us to explore how agents interact with the environment and each other (e.g., social networks), and how through such interactions aggregate patterns emerge (e.g., disease outbreaks, traffic jams). While the use of agent-based modeling has grown, one challenge remains, that of creating realistic, geographically-explicit, synthetic populations which incorporate social networks. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel method to create a synthetic population which incorporates social networks using the New York Metro Area as a test area. To demonstrate the generalizability of our synthetic population method and data to initialize models, three different types of agent-based models are introduced to explore a variety of urban problems: traffic, disaster response, and the spread of disease. These use cases not only demonstrate how our geographically-explicit synthetic population can be easily utilized for initializing agent populations which can explore a variety of urban problems, but also show how social networks can be integrated into such populations and large-scale simulations.},

Unlike simple random graph techniques, these methods use real world data sources and combine them with behavioral and social theories to synthesize networks. We develop a synthetic population for the United States modeling every individual in the population including household structure, demographics and a 24-hour activity sequence. The process involves collecting and manipulating public and proprietary data sets integrated into a common architecture for data exchange and then using these data sets to generate new relations. A social contact network is derived from the synthetic population based on physical co-location of interacting persons. We use graph measures to compare and contrast the structural characteristics of the social networks that span different urban regions. We then simulate diffusion processes on these networks and analyze similarities and differences in the structure of the networks.},

  abstract = {The advancement of machine learning techniques and the heterogeneous architectures of most current supercomputers are propelling the demand for large multiscale simulations that can automatically and autonomously couple diverse components and map them to relevant resources to solve complex problems at multiple scales. Nevertheless, despite the recent progress in workflow technologies, current capabilities are limited to coupling two scales. In the first-ever demonstration of using three scales of resolution, we present a scalable and generalizable framework that couples pairs of models using machine learning and in situ feedback. We expand upon the massively parallel Multiscale Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), a recent, award-winning workflow, and generalize the framework beyond its original design. We discuss the challenges and learnings in executing a massive multiscale simulation campaign that utilized over 600,000 node hours on Summit and achieved more than 98% GPU occupancy for more than 83% of the time. We present innovations to enable several orders of magnitude scaling, including simultaneously coordinating 24,000 jobs, and managing several TBs of new data per day and over a billion files in total. Finally, we describe the generalizability of our framework and, with an upcoming open-source release, discuss how the presented framework may be used for new applications.},

  abstract  = {Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

  abstract = {Supercomputers serve a lot of parallel jobs by scheduling jobs and allocating computing resources. One popular scheduling strategy is First Come First Serve (FCFS). However, there are always some idle resources not being effectively utilized, since they are not enough and are reserved for the head job in the waiting queue. To improve resource utilization, a common solution is to use backfilling, which allocates the reserved computing resources to a small, short job selected from the queue, on the premise of not delaying the original head job. Unfortunately, the estimated job runtime provided by users is often overestimated. Previous studies extract features from historical job logs and predict runtime based on machine learning. However, traditional features (e.g. CPU, user, submitting time, etc.) are insufficient to describe the characteristics of jobs. In this paper, we propose a novel runtime prediction framework called PREP. It explores a new feature named job running path, which encodes important implications about the job’s characteristics, such as the project it belongs to, data sets and parameters it uses, etc. As there is a strong correlation between job runtime and its running path. PREP groups jobs into separate clusters according to their running paths and trains a runtime prediction model for each job cluster. Final results demonstrate that adding the new feature can achieve high prediction accuracy of 88% and has a better prediction effect than other methods, such as Last-2 and IRPA.},

  abstract  = {EASY-Backfilling is a popular scheduling heuristic for allocating jobs in large scale High Performance Computing platforms. While its aggressive reservation mechanism is fast and prevents job starvation, it does not try to optimize any scheduling objective per se. We consider in this work the problem of tuning EASY using queue reordering policies. More precisely, we propose to tune the reordering using a simulation-based methodology. For a given system, we choose the policy in order to minimize the average waiting time. This methodology departs from the First-Come, First-Serve rule and introduces a risk on the maximum values of the waiting time, which we control using a queue thresholding mechanism. This new approach is evaluated through a comprehensive experimental campaign on five production logs. In particular, we show that the behavior of the systems under study is stable enough to learn a heuristic that generalizes in a train/test fashion. Indeed, the average waiting time can be reduced consistently (between 11{\%} to 42{\%} for the logs used) compared to EASY, with almost no increase in maximum waiting times. This work departs from previous learning-based approaches and shows that scheduling heuristics for HPC can be learned directly in a policy space.},

  abstract = {For job allocation decision, current batch schedulers have access to and use only information on the number of nodes and runtime because it is readily available at submission time from user job scripts. User-provided runtimes are typically inaccurate because users overestimate or lack understanding of job resource requirements. Beyond the number of nodes and runtime, other system resources, including IO and network, are not available but play a key role in system performance. There is the need for automatic, general, and scalable tools that provide accurate resource usage information to schedulers so that, by becoming resource-aware, they can better manage system resources.We tackle this need by presenting a tool for Predicting Runtime and IO using Neural Networks (PRIONN). PRIONN automates prediction of per-job runtime and IO resource usage, enabling IO-aware scheduling on HPC systems. The novelty of our tool is the input of whole job scripts into deep learning models that allows complete automation of runtime and IO resource predictions. We demonstrate the power of PRIONN with runtime and IO resource predictions applied to IO-aware scheduling for real HPC data. Specifically, we achieve over 75% mean and 98% median accuracy for runtime and IO predictions across 300,000 jobs from a real HPC machine. We combine our per-job runtime and IO predictions with queue and system simulations to predict future system IO usage accurately. We predict over 50% of IO bursts in advance on a real HPC system.},

  abstract  = {Power consumption is a critical aspect for next generation High Performance Computing systems: Supercomputers are expected to reach Exascale in 2023 but this will require a significant improvement in terms of energy efficiency. In this domain, power-capping can significant increase the final energy-efficiency by cutting cooling effort and worst-case design margins. A key aspect for an optimal implementation of power capping is the ability to estimate the power consumption of HPC applications before they run on the real system. In this paper we propose a Machine-Learning approach, based on the user and application resource request, to accurately predict the power consumption of typical supercomputer workloads. We demonstrate our method on real production workloads executed on the Eurora supercomputer hosted at CINECA computing center in Bologna and we provide useful insights to apply our technique in other installations.},

  abstract = {GPUs have become prevalent and more general purpose, but GPU programming remains challenging and time consuming for the majority of programmers. In addition, it is not always clear which codes will benefit from getting ported to GPU. Therefore, having a tool to estimate GPU performance for a piece of code before writing a GPU implementation is highly desirable. To this end, we propose Cross-Architecture Performance Prediction (XAPP), a machine-learning based technique that uses only single-threaded CPU implementation to predict GPU performance.Our paper is built on the two following insights: i) Execution time on GPU is a function of program properties and hardware characteristics. ii) By examining a vast array of previously implemented GPU codes along with their CPU counterparts, we can use established machine learning techniques to learn this correlation between program properties, hardware characteristics and GPU execution time. We use an adaptive two-level machine learning solution. Our results show that our tool is robust and accurate: we achieve 26.9% average error on a set of 24 real-world kernels. We also discuss practical usage scenarios for XAPP.},

  abstractnote = {Distributed data analysis frameworks are widely used for processing large datasets generated by instruments in scientific fields such as astronomy, genomics, and particle physics. Such frameworks partition petabyte-size datasets into chunks and execute many parallel tasks to search for common patterns, locate unusual signals, or compute aggregate properties. When well-configured, such frameworks make it easy to churn through large quantities of data on large clusters. However, configuring frameworks presents a challenge for end users, who must select a variety of parameters such as the blocking of the input data, the number of tasks, the resources allocated to each task, and the size of nodes on which they run. If poorly configured, the result may perform many orders of magnitude worse than optimal, or the application may even fail to make progress at all. Even if a good configuration is found through painstaking observations, the performance may change drastically when the input data or analysis kernel changes. This paper considers the problem of automatically configuring a data analysis application for high energy physics (TopEFT) built upon standard frameworks for physics analysis (Coffea) and distributed tasking (Work Queue). We observe the inherent variability within the application, demonstrate the problems of poor configuration, and then develop several techniques for automatically sizing tasks to meet goals of resource consumption, and overall application completion.},

abstract = {Modern software is incredibly complex. A typical application may comprise hundreds or thousands of reusable components. Automated package managers can help to maintain a consistent set of dependency versions, but ultimately the solvers in these systems rely on constraints generated by humans. At scale, small errors add up, and it becomes increasingly difficult to find high-fidelity configurations. We cannot test all configurations, because the space is combinatorial, so exhaustive exploration is infeasible.In this paper, we present Reliabuild, an auto-tuning framework that efficiently explores the build configuration space and learns which package versions are likely to result in a successful configuration. We implement two models in Reliabuild to rank the different configurations and use adaptive sampling to select good configurations with fewer samples. We demonstrate Reliabuild's effectiveness by evaluating 31,186 build configurations of 61 packages from the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S). Reliabuild selects good configurations efficiently. For example, Reliabuild selects 3\texttimes{} the number of good configurations in comparison to random sampling for several packages including Abyss, Bolt, libnrm, OpenMPI. Our framework is also able to select all the high-fidelity builds in half the number of samples required by random sampling for packages such as Chai, OpenMPI, py-petsc4py, and slepc. We further use the model to learn statistics about the compatibility of different packages, which will enable package solvers to better select high-fidelity build configurations automatically.},

This provides versatile methods to overcome the deterministic nature of the stable model semantics, such as resolving inconsistencies in answer set programs, ranking stable models, associating probability to stable models, and applying statistical inference to computing weighted stable models. We also present formal comparisons with related formalisms, such as answer set programs, Markov Logic, ProbLog, and P-log.},

Answer Set Prolog is used as the logical foundation, while causal Bayes nets serve as a probabilistic foundation. We give several non-trivial examples and illustrate the use of P-log for knowledge representation and updating of knowledge. We argue that our approach to updates is more appealing than existing approaches. We give sufficiency conditions for the coherency of P-log programs and show that Bayes nets can be easily mapped to coherent P-log programs.},

  year = {2007},
  publisher = {Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.},
  address = {San Francisco, CA, USA},
  abstract = {We introduce ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. A ProbLog program defines a distribution over logic programs by specifying for each clause the probability that it belongs to a randomly sampled program, and these probabilities are mutually independent. The semantics of ProbLog is then defined by the success probability of a query, which corresponds to the probability that the query succeeds in a randomly sampled program. The key contribution of this paper is the introduction of an effective solver for computing success probabilities. It essentially combines SLD-resolution with methods for computing the probability of Boolean formulae. Our implementation further employs an approximation algorithm that combines iterative deepening with binary decision diagrams. We report on experiments in the context of discovering links in real biological networks, a demonstration of the practical usefulness of the approach.},

  abstract = {A library is available in multiple versions. Which one should I use? Has it been widely adopted already? Was it a good decision to switch to the newest version? We have mined hundreds of open-source projects for their library dependencies, and determined global trends in library usage. This wisdom of the crowds can be helpful for developers when deciding when to use which version of a library - by helping them avoid pitfalls experienced by other developers, and by showing important emerging trends in library usage.},

  abstract="In recent years, language models (LMs), such as GPT-4, have been widely used in multiple domains, including natural language processing, visualization, and so on. However, applying them for analyzing and optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) software is still challenging due to the lack of HPC-specific support. In this paper, we design the LM4HPC framework to facilitate the research and development of HPC software analyses and optimizations using LMs. Tailored for supporting HPC datasets, AI models, and pipelines, our framework is built on top of a range of components from different levels of the machine learning software stack, with Hugging Face-compatible APIs. Using three representative tasks, we evaluated the prototype of our framework. The results show that LM4HPC can help users quickly evaluate a set of state-of-the-art models and generate insightful leaderboards.",

	abstract = {The COVID-19 global outbreak represents the most significant epidemic event since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Simulations have played a crucial role in supporting COVID-19 planning and response efforts. Developing scalable workflows to provide policymakers quick responses to important questions pertaining to logistics, resource allocation, epidemic forecasts and intervention analysis remains a challenging computational problem. In this work, we present scalable high performance computing-enabled workflows for COVID-19 pandemic planning and response. The scalability of our methodology allows us to run fine-grained simulations daily, and to generate county-level forecasts and other counterfactual analysis for each of the 50 states (and DC), 3140 counties across the USA. Our workflows use a hybrid cloud/cluster system utilizing a combination of local and remote cluster computing facilities, and using over 20,000 CPU cores running for 6-9 hours every day to meet this objective. Our state (Virginia), state hospital network, our university, the DOD and the CDC use our models to guide their COVID-19 planning and response efforts. We began executing these pipelines March 25, 2020, and have delivered and briefed weekly updates to these stakeholders for over 30 weeks without interruption.},

	abstract = {In Spring 2021, the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant began to cause increases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in parts of the United States. At the time, with slowed vaccination uptake, this novel variant was expected to increase the risk of pandemic resurgence in the US in summer and fall 2021. As part of the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, an ensemble of nine mechanistic models produced 6-month scenario projections for July–December 2021 for the United States. These projections estimated substantial resurgences of COVID-19 across the US resulting from the more transmissible Delta variant, projected to occur across most of the US, coinciding with school and business reopening. The scenarios revealed that reaching higher vaccine coverage in July–December 2021 reduced the size and duration of the projected resurgence substantially, with the expected impacts was largely concentrated in a subset of states with lower vaccination coverage. Despite accurate projection of COVID-19 surges occurring and timing, the magnitude was substantially underestimated 2021 by the models compared with the of the reported cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occurring during July–December, highlighting the continued challenges to predict the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination uptake remains critical to limiting transmission and disease, particularly in states with lower vaccination coverage. Higher vaccination goals at the onset of the surge of the new variant were estimated to avert over 1.5 million cases and 21,000 deaths, although may have had even greater impacts, considering the underestimated resurgence magnitude from the model.},

	abstract = {Recent human deaths due to infection by highly pathogenic (H5N1) avian influenza A virus have raised the specter of a devastating pandemic like that of 1917–1918, should this avian virus evolve to become readily transmissible among humans. We introduce and use a large-scale stochastic simulation model to investigate the spread of a pandemic strain of influenza virus through the U.S. population of 281 million individuals for R0 (the basic reproductive number) from 1.6 to 2.4. We model the impact that a variety of levels and combinations of influenza antiviral agents, vaccines, and modified social mobility (including school closure and travel restrictions) have on the timing and magnitude of this spread. Our simulations demonstrate that, in a highly mobile population, restricting travel after an outbreak is detected is likely to delay slightly the time course of the outbreak without impacting the eventual number ill. For R0 {\textless} 1.9, our model suggests that the rapid production and distribution of vaccines, even if poorly matched to circulating strains, could significantly slow disease spread and limit the number ill to {\textless}10\% of the population, particularly if children are preferentially vaccinated. Alternatively, the aggressive deployment of several million courses of influenza antiviral agents in a targeted prophylaxis strategy may contain a nascent outbreak with low R0, provided adequate contact tracing and distribution capacities exist. For higher R0, we predict that multiple strategies in combination (involving both social and medical interventions) will be required to achieve similar limits on illness rates.},

This pipeline can run 400 replicates of national runs in less than 33 h, and reduces the need for human intervention, resulting in faster turnaround times and higher reliability and accuracy of the results.

abstract = {Thicket is an open-source Python toolkit for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of multi-run performance experiments. It enables an understanding of optimal performance configuration for large-scale application codes. Most performance tools focus on a single execution (e.g., single platform, single measurement tool, single scale). Thicket bridges the gap to convenient analysis in multi-dimensional, multi-scale, multi-architecture, and multi-tool performance datasets by providing an interface for interacting with the performance data. Thicket has a modular structure composed of three components. The first component is a data structure for multi-dimensional performance data, which is composed automatically on the portable basis of call trees, and accommodates any subset of dimensions present in the dataset. The second is the metadata, enabling distinction and sub-selection of dimensions in performance data. The third is a dimensionality reduction mechanism, enabling analysis such as computing aggregated statistics on a given data dimension. Extensible mechanisms are available for applying analyses (e.g., top-down on Intel CPUs), data science techniques (e.g., K-means clustering from scikit-learn), modeling performance (e.g., Extra-P), and interactive visualization. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of Thicket through two case studies, first with the open-source RAJA Performance Suite on CPU and GPU clusters and another with a large physics simulation run on both a traditional HPC cluster and an AWS Parallel Cluster instance.},

	abstract = {This paper describes EpiHiper, a state-of-the art high performance computational modeling framework supporting epidemic science. The EpiHiper modeling framework permits custom disease models and can simulate epidemics over dynamic, large-scale networks, while supporting modulation of the epidemic evolution through a set of user-programmable interventions. The nodes and edges of the social-contact network have customizable sets of static and dynamic attributes which allow the user to specify intervention target sets at a very fine-grained level; these also permit the network to be updated in response to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures. The execution of interventions is governed by trigger conditions, Boolean expressions formed using any of EpiHiper’s primitives and sets. Rich expressiveness, extensibility and high performance computing performance were central design goals to ensure that the framework could effectively target realistic scenarios at the scale and detail required to support state and federal public health policymakers in their efforts to plan and respond in the event of epidemics. The modeling framework is currently being used to support the CDC scenario modeling hub for COVID-19 response. EpiHiper was a part of a hybrid high-performance cloud system that was nominated as a finalist for the 2021 ACM Gordon Bell Special Prize for HPC-based COVID-19 Research.},

abstract = {Large deep learning models have shown great potential with state-of-the-art results in many tasks. However, running these large models is quite challenging on an accelerator (GPU or TPU) because the on-device memory is too limited for the size of these models. Intra-layer model parallelism is an approach to address the issues by partitioning individual layers or operators across multiple devices in a distributed accelerator cluster. But, the data communications generated by intra-layer model parallelism can contribute to a significant proportion of the overall execution time and severely hurt the computational efficiency. As intra-layer model parallelism is critical to enable large deep learning models, this paper proposes a novel technique to effectively reduce its data communication overheads by overlapping communication with computation. With the proposed technique, an identified original communication collective is decomposed along with the dependent computation operation into a sequence of finer-grained operations. By creating more overlapping opportunities and executing the newly created, finer-grained communication and computation operations in parallel, it effectively hides the data transfer latency and achieves a better system utilization. Evaluated on TPU v4 Pods using different types of large models that have 10 billion to 1 trillion parameters, the proposed technique improves system throughput by 1.14 - 1.38x. The achieved highest peak FLOPS utilization is 72\% on 1024 TPU chips with a large language model that has 500 billion parameters.},
